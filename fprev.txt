This page lists pending and open tasks being considered or worked upon
by the OpenOCD community.

@section thelist The List

Most items are open for the taking, but please post to the mailing list
before spending much time working on anything lists here.  The community
may have evolved an idea since it was added here.

Feel free to send patches to add or clarify items on this list, too.

@section thelisttcl TCL

This section provides possible things to improve with OpenOCD's TCL support.
- Fix problem with incorrect line numbers reported for a syntax
  error in a reset init event.
- organize the TCL configurations:
  - provide more directory structure for boards/targets?
  - factor configurations into layers (encapsulation and re-use)
- Fix handling of variables between multiple command line "-c" and "-f"
  parameters.  Currently variables assigned through one such parameter
  command/script are unset before the next one is invoked.
- Isolate all TCL command support:
  - Pure C CLI implementations using --disable-builtin-tcl.
    - Allow developers to build new dongles using OpenOCD's JTAG core.
    - At first, provide only low-level JTAG support; target layer and
      above rely heavily on scripting event mechanisms.
