- use tap_set_state everywhere to allow logging TAP state transitions

The following tasks have been suggested for cleaning up the JTAG layer:

@subsection thelistjtagcore JTAG Core
))
This section list issues that need to be resolved in the JTAG layer.
@section thelistjtag JTAG

    - allow some of these TCL command modules to be dynamically loadable?
    - See src/jtag/core.c and src/jtag/tcl.c for an example.
  - Move TCL support out of foo.[ch] and into foo_tcl.[ch] (other ideas?)
  - Allow full TCL support? add --with-tcl=/path/to/installed/tcl
      above rely heavily on scripting event mechanisms.
    - At first, provide only low-level JTAG support; target layer and
    - Allow developers to build new dongles using OpenOCD's JTAG core.
  - Pure C CLI implementations using --disable-builtin-tcl.
- Isolate all TCL command support:

  command/script are unset before the next one is invoked.
  parameters.  Currently variables assigned through one such parameter
- Fix handling of variables between multiple command line "-c" and "-f"

  - factor configurations into layers (encapsulation and re-use)
  - provide more directory structure for boards/targets?
- organize the TCL configurations:

  error in a reset init event.
- Fix problem with incorrect line numbers reported for a syntax
