A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a
transponder;
it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth.
Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.
There are over 2,000
communications satellites in Earthâ€™s orbit, used by both private and government organizations.
Satellite Communication utilization has become wide spread and ubiquitous throughout the country for such diverse
applications like Television, DTH Broadcasting, DSNG and VSAT to exploit the unique capabilities in terms of coverage and
outreach.
The technology has matured substantially over past three decades and is being used on commercial basis for a large
number of applications. Most of us are touched by satellite communication in more ways than we realize.
The potential of the technology for societal applications continue to fascinate ISRO and efforts are on to leverage the
benefits of technology to the betterment of mankind. Important initiatives pursued by ISRO towards societal development
include Tele-education, Tele-medicine, Village Resource Centre (VRC) and Disaster Management System (DMS) Programmes.
The potential of the space technology for applications of national development is enormous.
